In the lush heart of Central America, where rainforests meet the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, Costa Rica stands poised at the threshold of a new economic epoch. The FolioChain Protocol (FCP) emerges as the vanguard of this transformation, reimagining access, transparency, and trust in the realm of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.
