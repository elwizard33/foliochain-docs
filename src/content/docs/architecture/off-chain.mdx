title: Off-Chain Components
description: The intelligent bridge between law and ledger, powered by AI oracles and decentralized storage
---

import { Tabs, TabItem, Steps, Aside, Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The FolioChain Protocol's off-chain architecture serves as the sinew and synapse that binds the deterministic certainty of blockchain to the mutable, analog realities of Costa Rican property law and market practice. Here, intelligence is not merely artificial but adaptive‚Äîan ensemble of AI-powered oracles, decentralized storage, user-centric interfaces, and notarial partnerships, each engineered to resolve the frictions of a jurisdiction where digital and legal worlds remain stubbornly apart.

## Agentic Oracle Layer: Making Smart Contracts Truly Smart

<Aside type="tip">
**The Paradigm Shift**: FolioChain introduces **Agentic AI Oracles**‚Äîautonomous agents that don't just validate data, but perceive changes, reason about strategies, plan workflows, and execute actions. This transforms smart contracts from passive rule executors into proactive intelligent systems.
</Aside>

### From Passive Oracles to Autonomous Agents

Traditional blockchain oracles are reactive data feeds: they wait for queries, fetch information, and return results. FolioChain's Agentic Oracle Layer represents a fundamental evolution:

**Traditional Oracles:**
- ‚ùå Wait for external function calls
- ‚ùå Execute predefined queries
- ‚ùå Return data without context or optimization
- ‚ùå No learning or adaptation
- ‚ùå Require human orchestration for complex workflows

**Agentic Oracles:**
- ‚úÖ **Perceive** environmental changes proactively (Registry updates, regulatory changes, market events)
- ‚úÖ **Reason** using LLM-powered decision engines with Costa Rican legal context
- ‚úÖ **Plan** multi-step workflows with fallback strategies and optimization
- ‚úÖ **Act** by directly calling smart contract functions as autonomous agents
- ‚úÖ **Learn** from outcomes, human feedback, and historical patterns

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="caution" title="Intelligence in Action: The 52% Problem">
**Scenario**: Foreign investor wants to buy tokens that would push ownership to 52% of a maritime zone property. Legal cap is 49%.

**Rigid System Response**: ‚ùå REJECT TRANSACTION

**Intelligent Agent Response**: 
1. ü§î **Reasons**: "Investor wants maximum allocation. Full request violates cap. What's the compliant alternative?"
2. üí° **Calculates**: Exact number of tokens to reach 49% = 73 tokens
3. üìã **Proposes**: "Buy 73 tokens now (compliant max), queue remaining 27 for when other investors sell"
4. ‚úÖ **Result**: Transaction succeeds, investor gets maximum allocation, 100% compliance maintained

**Outcome**: Happy investor, perfect compliance, optimized experience.

## üìã Planning Module: Strategic Workflow Orchestration

<Aside type="note" title="Beyond Simple Automation">
This isn't a rigid script that breaks when something unexpected happens. The agent dynamically creates multi-step plans, adapts when conditions change, and finds alternative paths to goals.
</Aside>

### How the Agent Plans Complex Operations

<Steps>

1. **üéØ Goal Definition**
   
   Receives objective from reasoning engine (e.g., "Tokenize this property while optimizing for speed and cost")

2. **üó∫Ô∏è Path Mapping**
   
   Identifies all required steps: Registry verification ‚Üí KYC checks ‚Üí Document collection ‚Üí Compliance validation ‚Üí Smart contract deployment

3. **‚ö° Parallel Optimization**
   
   Determines which tasks can run simultaneously (KYC while documents are gathered) vs. must be sequential (compliance must follow KYC)

4. **üõ°Ô∏è Contingency Design**
   
   Prepares backup strategies for common failure points: What if notary delays? What if Registry data is incomplete?

5. **‚è±Ô∏è Resource Allocation**
   
   Schedules tasks based on priority, deadlines, and system capacity

6. **üöÄ Execution Launch**
   
   Coordinates parallel workflows and monitors progress in real-time

</Steps>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Dynamic Replanning" icon="reload">
    When conditions change mid-execution (regulatory update, price shift, data unavailable), the agent **automatically** adjusts the plan without human intervention.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dependency Management" icon="puzzle">
    Tracks complex relationships between tasks‚Äîknows exactly which steps unlock others and optimizes the critical path.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cost Optimization" icon="seti:config">
    Batches operations when possible, waits for lower gas prices when not urgent, and minimizes redundant work.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="Planning in Action: Weekend Tokenization">
**Goal**: Tokenize property by Monday market open (72 hours away)

**Agent's Plan**:

<Steps>

1. **Friday 6 PM**: Initiate Registry verification (12-hour process) ‚è∞
2. **Friday 6 PM**: *Parallel* ‚Üí Begin owner KYC collection ‚ö°
3. **Saturday 6 AM**: Registry data complete ‚úÖ ‚Üí Start document analysis
4. **Saturday 10 AM**: KYC complete ‚úÖ ‚Üí Submit compliance checks
5. **Saturday 2 PM**: Compliance approved ‚úÖ ‚Üí Queue smart contract deployment

### Real-World Safety Example

<Aside type="tip" title="Circuit Breaker Activation">
**Scenario**: Agent detects unusual spike in foreign investor applications for ZMT properties

**Trigger Detection**:
- ÔøΩ Normal rate: 2-3 applications/day  
- üö® Current rate: 47 applications in 2 hours
- ü§î Agent confidence: "Possible bot attack or coordination"

**Automatic Circuit Breaker Response**:
1. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pause Tier 1 autonomous KYC approvals** (0.3 seconds)
2. ÔøΩ **Alert oversight committee** immediately
3. üîí **Queue all new applications** for human review
4. üìä **Generate anomaly report** with pattern analysis
5. ‚úÖ **Continue monitoring** other operations normally

**Human Investigation**:
- Analysts discover legitimate marketing campaign launched by real estate agency
- Applications are genuine, just concentrated in time
- Oversight approves batch after verification

**Resolution**:
- ‚úÖ Circuit breaker deactivated after 4 hours
- ü§ñ Agent learns: "Marketing campaigns cause spikes‚Äînot always attacks"
- üìà Future similar patterns recognized, auto-escalate to Tier 2 instead of full pause

**Outcome**: False alarm, but system **prevented potential exploitation** while maintaining operations.

### The Verification Pipeline: From Raw Data to Truth

<Aside type="note" title="AI-Powered Legal Intelligence">
Costa Rican property documents are complex, handwritten, and in Spanish. FolioChain's AI reads them like an expert legal clerk‚Äîbut faster and more accurately.
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. **üìÑ Document Acquisition**
   
   Oracle retrieves property document from National Registry (usually scanned PDF)

2. **üîç OCR Extraction**
   
   Advanced optical character recognition reads handwritten Spanish text, extracting raw content from scanned images

3. **üß† NLP Analysis**
   
   Natural language processing trained on Costa Rican legal terminology identifies key entities:
   - Property owner name & ID (c√©dula)
   - Folio real (unique property identifier)
   - Liens, encumbrances, restrictions
   - Title status (clear, encumbered, disputed)

4. **üìä Data Normalization**
   
   AI converts varied document formats into standardized data structures for comparison

5. **üîó Cross-Source Validation**
   
   Information from Registry is compared against:
   - Notary attestations for the same property
   - Previous blockchain records
   - Regulatory databases (SUGEF sanctions, tax liens)

6. **üö® Anomaly Detection**
   
   Machine learning flags suspicious patterns:
   - Rapid ownership changes (possible fraud)
   - Signature inconsistencies across documents
   - Registry vs Notary data mismatches
   - Unusual transaction timing

7. **ü§ù Consensus Calculation**
   
   Multiple independent oracles must agree (e.g., 4 out of 5 minimum) before data is accepted as canonical

8. **‚öñÔ∏è Human Escalation**
   
   If consensus fails or anomalies detected, case automatically escalates to human notary for review

</Steps>

### Consensus & Confidence Scoring

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="üéØ Multi-Oracle Agreement" icon="approve-check-circle">
    **How It Works**:
    
    5 independent oracles process same document ‚Üí Each produces data extraction ‚Üí System compares results
    
    **Threshold**: Minimum 4/5 (80%) agreement required
    
    **On Disagreement**: Escalates to human review, logs discrepancy for learning
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üìä Confidence Scores" icon="star">
    **AI Assigns Certainty**:
    
    Each extraction gets 0-100% confidence score based on:
    - Document quality (clear vs blurry scan)
    - Text legibility (typed vs handwritten)
    - Data completeness (all fields present?)
    - Historical accuracy (past performance)
    
    **Threshold**: 85% minimum for autonomous acceptance
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üîê Cryptographic Anchoring" icon="seti:lock">
    **Immutable Audit Trail**:
    
    All verified data is:
    - Hashed (SHA-256)
    - Signed by oracle
    - Timestamped on-chain
    - Linked to source document
    
    **Result**: Provable data integrity and legal enforceability

    Example consensus calculation:
    - 3 automated oracles say "Clear title" = 3 votes
    - 1 notary says "Clear title" = 3 votes
    - **Total**: 6 votes for "Clear title"
    
    If notary disagrees with automation:
    - Notary opinion wins (human expert > AI)
    - Case escalated for review
    - Automated oracles retrained

### Dual-Purpose Legal Bridge

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="üì± Digital Protocol" icon="rocket">
    **Blockchain Oracle**
    
    Notary attestations serve as:
    - High-trust oracle data inputs
    - Weighted heavily in consensus mechanisms
    - Cryptographic proof of legal review
    - Instant on-chain verification
    
    **Speed**: Real-time blockchain integration
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üèõÔ∏è Legal System" icon="document">
    **Court-Admissible Evidence**
    
    Same attestations recognized by:
    - Costa Rican courts
    - SUGEVAL (securities regulator)
    - National Registry
    - Tax authorities
    
    **Why**: Notary digital signature = legal signature under CR law
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

<Aside type="tip" title="Legal Innovation">
**Breakthrough**: FolioChain's notary integration is the **first system** where a Costa Rican notarial act is simultaneously:

1. ‚õìÔ∏è **Blockchain oracle data** (immediate smart contract response)
2. üìú **Legally binding document** (court-admissible evidence)

This dual nature is what makes tokenized real estate **truly enforceable** in Costa Rica.

### Dispute Resolution Flow

<Aside type="caution" title="When Oracles Disagree">
Oracle consensus < 80% or anomaly detected ‚Üí Automatic dispute resolution process
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. **üîí Automatic Token Pause**
   
   Affected property tokens immediately frozen‚Äîno transfers allowed until resolved

2. **üì¢ Stakeholder Notification**
   
   All relevant parties alerted:
   - Property owner/issuer
   - Token holders
   - Assigned notary
   - Oversight committee
   - Regulatory dashboard update

3. **üìä Evidence Compilation**
   
   System automatically gathers:
   - All conflicting oracle data
   - Source documents and hashes
   - Transaction history
   - Previous attestations
   - Audit trail

4. **‚öñÔ∏è Expert Review**
   
   Qualified notary reviews evidence:
   - Registry verification
   - Document authenticity check
   - Legal opinion on discrepancy
   - Recommended resolution

5. **üó≥Ô∏è Resolution Path**
   
   Depending on severity:
   - **Minor**: Notary resolves, tokens unfrozen (2-3 days)
   - **Major**: Governance vote required (7-14 days)
   - **Legal**: Court arbitration (weeks to months)

6. **‚úÖ System Update**
   
   Once resolved:
   - Corrected data propagated to all oracles
   - Smart contracts updated
   - Tokens unfrozen
   - All parties notified
   - Incident logged for learning

</Steps>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="‚è±Ô∏è Avg Resolution Time" icon="seti:clock">
    **3.2 days** (vs 14+ days traditional dispute process)
    
    **Why Faster**: Evidence pre-compiled, clear escalation paths, incentivized notaries
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üìä Dispute Rate" icon="bars">
    **0.8%** of all property tokenizations encounter oracle disputes
    
    **Of those**: 73% resolved at notary level, 27% escalate to governance
