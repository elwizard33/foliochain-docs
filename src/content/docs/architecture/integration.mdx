## Integration Architecture

The FolioChain Protocol integrates blockchain with Costa Rica's legal and regulatory frameworks through three key subsystems:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Oracle Network" icon="magnifier">
    Multi-source truth synthesis combining National Registry scraping, notary attestations, and regulatory data feeds.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Compliance Engine" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Real-time validation against SUGEVAL, SUGEF, ZMT, and Hacienda requirements with automated audit trails.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Blockchain Anchoring" icon="star">
    Immutable on-chain records via ERC-3643 extensions on Polygon, ensuring regulatory compliance meets DeFi composability.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Oracle Data Flow: Manual vs Autonomous

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Traditional Flow">
    **Human-Orchestrated Data Validation**
    
    <Steps>
    1. **Data Collection**
       
       Registry bots scrape National Registry, Notarios authenticate documents, regulatory APIs provide SUGEVAL/SUGEF data.
    
    2. **Consensus Mechanism**
       
       AI engine compares all sources, assigns confidence scores, flags discrepancies for human review.
    
    3. **Threshold Validation**
       
       Only data achieving 95%+ confidence across 3+ sources proceeds to compliance checks.
    
    4. **On-Chain Anchoring**
       
       Verified data is hashed and stored immutably on Polygon with cryptographic proofs.
    </Steps>
    
    **Limitations**: Requires human monitoring, reactive problem detection, manual workflow orchestration.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Agentic Flow">
    **Autonomous Agent-Driven Workflow**
    
    <Steps>
    1. **Proactive Perception**
       
       Agent continuously monitors Registry changes 24/7, detecting tokenization opportunities before humans notice.
    
    2. **Intelligent Reasoning**
       
       LLM-powered agent analyzes legal context, assesses compliance complexity, determines optimal strategy.
    
    3. **Adaptive Planning**
       
       Agent decomposes tokenization into steps, identifies dependencies, selects fallback strategies for edge cases.
    
    4. **Autonomous Execution**
       
       Agent directly calls smart contract functions: `agentInitiateKYC()`, `agentUpdateOracle()`, `agentMintToken()`.
    
    5. **Predictive Optimization**
       
       Agent learns from outcomes, predicts bottlenecks, proactively resolves issues before they block progress.
    
    6. **Self-Anchoring**
       
       Agent cryptographically signs attestations, anchors data on-chain, emits audit events‚Äîall without human intervention.
    </Steps>
    
    **Advantages**: Proactive monitoring, 75% less human effort, intelligent problem-solving, continuous learning.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Autonomous Workflow Examples

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Agent-Initiated Tokenization" icon="rocket">
    **Trigger**: Agent detects Registry update showing property lien released
    
    **Agent Actions**:
    1. Validates property now has clear title
    2. Identifies owner from Registry data
    3. Checks if owner has FolioChain account
    4. Sends personalized tokenization proposal
    5. If accepted, orchestrates full workflow
    6. Deploys tokens to DEX within 30 days
    
    **Human Involvement**: Zero (unless edge case detected)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Compliance Optimization" icon="approve-check-circle">
    **Trigger**: Investor attempts ZMT property purchase violating 49% foreign cap
    
    **Agent Actions**:
    1. Detects impending violation before transaction
    2. Calculates maximum compliant purchase amount
    3. Proposes partial fill: "Buy 73 tokens now, queue 27 for later"
    4. Executes compliant portion immediately
    5. Monitors for future cap availability
    6. Auto-completes queued order when possible
    
    **Result**: Transaction succeeds vs rejected
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Predictive KYC Renewal" icon="information">
    **Trigger**: Agent predicts KYC expiration in 14 days
    
    **Agent Actions**:
    1. Sends proactive renewal notification
    2. Pre-fills renewal form with existing data
    3. Schedules automatic submission
    4. Monitors approval status
    5. Updates Identity Registry upon approval
    6. Ensures zero service interruption
    
    **Human Involvement**: User clicks "Approve" only
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Autonomous Dispute Resolution" icon="warning">
    **Trigger**: Oracle consensus drops to 87% (Registry-Notary conflict)
    
    **Agent Actions**:
    1. Immediately freezes affected tokens
    2. Requests clarification from conflicting sources
    3. Gathers additional evidence from archives
    4. Escalates to notary review with evidence package
    5. Coordinates resolution timeline
    6. Unfreezes tokens upon consensus restoration

## Compliance Workflow

The compliance engine validates every transaction against Costa Rican regulations:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="KYC/AML">
    **SUGEF Verification**
    
    - Identity verification via c√©dula
    - PEP screening (politically exposed persons)
    - Sanctions list cross-checking
    - Source of funds validation
    
    **Automated** for most users, **manual review** for high-risk profiles.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Securities">
    **SUGEVAL Classification**
    
    - Determine security type (equity, debt, hybrid)
    - Prospectus requirements
    - Investor suitability checks
    - Ongoing disclosure obligations
    
    **One-time** classification, **continuous** compliance monitoring.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Foreign Caps">
    **ZMT Restrictions**
    
    - Maritime zone properties: **49% foreign ownership max**
    - Real-time tracking of foreign investor percentages
    - Automatic trade blocking at cap thresholds
    - Smart contract enforcement
    
    **Prevents** regulatory violations **before** they occur.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Taxation">
    **Hacienda Integration**
    
    - Property tax (IBI) status verification
    - Transfer tax (1.5%) automation
    - Capital gains tax reporting
    - Yield distribution tax withholding
    
    **Auto-calculates** and **remits** taxes on all transactions.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Transaction Lifecycle

Every property tokenization follows this standardized path:

<Steps>

1. **Asset Submission**
   
   Issuer submits property documentation (Folio Real, title, appraisal, surveys).

2. **Oracle Verification** *(10-30 days)*
   
   Multi-source validation achieves 95%+ confidence across National Registry, notary, and regulatory feeds.

3. **Compliance Checks** *(20-40 days)*
   
   SUGEVAL classification, SUGEF KYC/AML, ZMT foreign cap setup, Hacienda tax registration.

4. **Smart Contract Deploy** *(15-30 days)*
   
   ERC-3643 extension deployed, master NFT minted, fractional ERC-1155 created.

5. **Primary Issuance**
   
   Tokens offered to vetted investors, funds escrowed until minimum raise threshold met.

6. **Secondary Trading**
   
   Tokens list on compliant DEX, 24/7 peer-to-peer trading with automated compliance enforcement.

7. **Yield Distribution**
   
   Rental income distributed quarterly via smart contracts, taxes auto-withheld.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
**Average Timeline**: 45-100 days from submission to tradeable token  
**Compliance Rate**: 100% ‚Äî no token trades without passing all checks  
**Uptime**: 99.9% ‚Äî Polygon blockchain ensures 24/7 availability
</Aside>

## Notary Integration

Costa Rican notarios (licensed attorneys) provide critical legal attestations:

### Notary Workflow

<Steps>

1. **Document Authentication**
   
   Notary reviews physical title documents, verifies signatures, and confirms chain of custody.

2. **Digital Attestation**
   
   Notary signs cryptographic hash of verified documents using their licensed digital signature.

3. **Oracle Submission**
   
   Signed attestation submitted to FolioChain oracle network as primary data source.

4. **Cross-Verification**
   
   Oracle compares notary data with Registry scrapes and regulatory feeds for consensus.

5. **Dispute Handling**
   
   If discrepancies arise, notary provides tiebreaker opinion with legal weight.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Legal Authority">
Notary attestations carry **legal weight** in Costa Rican courts. Any fraudulent attestation subjects the notary to **license revocation** and **criminal prosecution**.
</Aside>

  </Card>

  <Card title="Conflict Resolution" icon="warning">
    **Blockchain as Source of Truth** for ownership  
    **Registry as Source of Truth** for legal status  
    **Manual Review** for contradictions  
    **Court Rulings** as final arbiter
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

---

## Dispute Resolution

When data sources conflict or legal challenges arise:

<Steps>

1. **Automated Flagging**
   
   Oracle detects confidence score below 95% or contradictions between sources.

2. **Human Review**
   
   FolioChain compliance team reviews flagged data, requests additional documentation.

3. **Notary Mediation**
   
   Licensed notary investigates, provides legally binding opinion on correct data.

4. **Stakeholder Negotiation**
   
   If notary opinion disputed, issuer and challengers negotiate resolution.

5. **Arbitration**
   
   Unresolved disputes escalate to CINDE arbitration panel (faster than courts).

6. **Court Intervention**
   
   Final recourse: Costa Rican civil courts issue binding rulings.

7. **Blockchain Update**
   
   Dispute resolution outcome triggers on-chain state changes (token freeze, ownership transfer, etc.).

</Steps>

<Aside type="danger" title="Token Freeze Mechanism">
During active disputes, smart contracts **automatically freeze** affected tokens to prevent fraudulent transfers. Trading resumes only after dispute resolution.
</Aside>

## Integration Best Practices

For developers building on FolioChain:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Use Webhooks" icon="rocket">
    Subscribe to on-chain events via webhooks rather than polling. Reduces load and ensures real-time updates.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Cache Aggressively" icon="laptop">
    Oracle data changes rarely. Cache responses for 24 hours, invalidate on Registry update events.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Handle Failures Gracefully" icon="warning">
    Implement exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and fallback data sources for resilience.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Validate Everything" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Never trust client-side data. Always re-verify compliance checks server-side before transactions.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
